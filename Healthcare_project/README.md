# Healthcare dataset - Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost

### Project Description: 
*From patient healthcare data, can we predict patient test results?* <br>
In this project, I have:
- Cleaned the dataset, performed EDA and feature engineered
- Implemented Random Forest Classifier
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
- Conducted cross-validation to optimize model performance
- Analysed feature importances to understand key predictive variables

### Data
This dataset contains information about patients admitted to a hospital, including demographic details, medical conditions, treatments, and billing information. The dataset comprises the following columns:

- **Name**: Column represents patient's name on health record <br>
- **Age**: age of patient at time of admission in years <br>
- **Gender**: patient gender either "Male" or "Female" <br>
- **Blood type**: Patient's bloodtype of the common ones "A+", "O-" etc <br>
- **Medical condition**: primary medical condition or diagnosis associated with patient <br>
- **Date of admission**: date patient was admitted to the facility <br>
- **Doctor**: Name of doctor responsible for care during admission <br>
- **Hospital**: Name of hospital or facility where patient was admitted <br>
- **Insurance provider**: patient's insurance provider <br>
- **Billing amount**: amount of money billed to patient for their healthcare services during admission <br>
- **Room number**: Room number where patient was accomodated during admission <br>
- **Discharge date**: Date patient was discharged from healthcare facility <br>
- **Medication**: Identifies medication prescribed during their admission <br>
